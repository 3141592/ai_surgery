# "Interventions, probes, and controlled damage to language models"

## Environments

This repo intentionally uses **two Python virtual environments**:

- **PyTorch / TransformerLens**
  - venv: `~/venvs/pytorch`
  - requirements: `requirements-torch.txt`
  - runner: `./run-torch`

- **TensorFlow / Keras**
  - venv: `~/venvs/tf-keras`
  - requirements: `requirements-tf.txt`
  - runner: `./run-tf`

Scripts must be run using the appropriate runner.
Mixing frameworks in one venv is intentionally avoided.
