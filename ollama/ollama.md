# Ollama Proof of Concept

## Purpose
The purpose is to experiment embedding a local Ollama model in scripts used to explore model internals.

## 02-15-2026

### What question pulled me here?
I wanted to access a local model via the Ollama service from a Python script.

### What did I actually do?
I started a proof-of-concept script line-by-line using ChatGPT as the starter.

In additional, I updated my VS Code environment with additional keyboard bindings, and added a Vim extension to use vim in the editor.

### What do I think I understand a little better now (or still don’t)?
I now seee how to post requests to a specific model in Ollama.

I still do not have a clear idea of how I will use it. Probably the next POC will be combining Ollama requests with transformer-lens.
